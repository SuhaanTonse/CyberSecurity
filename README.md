# Cyber Security

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and sensitive information from malicious attacks.

We currently live in a digital era. The banking system, healthcare system, financial institutions, governments, and manufacturing sectors all use devices connected to the internet. Millions of people's personal information may be exposed as a result of a single security breach. Therefore, it is crucial to have cyber security to shield both individuals and businesses from cyber criminals.
